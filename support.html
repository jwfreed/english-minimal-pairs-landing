    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Why don't I need a microphone?</h3>
    <p>The core problem isn't your speaking - it's your perception. You can't pronounce sounds you can't hear. By training your ear first through listening exercises, speaking improvement follows naturally. No recording or speech analysis needed.</p>

    <h3>How long until I see results?</h3>
    <p>Most learners notice improved perception within 2-3 weeks of daily practice (10-15 minutes). Your brain needs time to build new neural pathways for sound discrimination, but the changes are measurable and permanent.</p>

    <h3>Is this suitable for my native language?</h3>
    <p>Yes! The app includes targeted minimal pairs for speakers of Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, Thai, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, and many other languages. The exercises adapt to the specific phonemic challenges of your L1 background.</p>

    <h3>Can I use this alongside other learning methods?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Soundwise complements any English learning program. Think of it as specialized ear training that makes all your other practice more effective. Once you can hear the differences, speaking practice becomes much more productive.</p>

    <h3>What if I'm an advanced learner?</h3>
    <p>Even advanced speakers often have perception blind spots from their L1. The app's adaptive algorithm will quickly identify your specific challenges and focus on those, making it valuable at any level.</p>
